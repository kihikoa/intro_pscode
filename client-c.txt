Task C: Product Package Counter

Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. 
Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. 

Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

#products = 0
#case = 0 

# for I in scans:

# if products > or == 50

	case = case +1 
	products = 0 


	

# products = products + 2

#print case
